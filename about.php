    <div class="bio">
        <p>I’m a web designer and developer. And a Yoobee School of Design graduate. </p>
        <p>I enjoy listening to clients share their visions, goals or even problems and turning those into ideas and plans. Then using that to fuel the creative journey of continuous exploration, refinement and perfection to reach the ultimate design.</p>
        <p>My favourite part of this work is the development though, turning the design into a functioning application. I love problem solving and every project there is a new challenge. The mindset I’ve learnt from this work is that there is never anything that can’t be done. Just some things take a little more time and determination.</p>
        <p>A huge part of my work is the ethics of what I’m doing. I believe we can all make a huge difference in the world by using the skills we have and the work we are trained for, to help our planet and the people on it. My goal is to use my skills to support clients and work with companies who have a mission to do good for this planet.</p>
        <p>When I’m not working on my laptop, you’ll probably find me outdoors. I love being active, exploring new places, and especially going tramping in the bush. I enjoy photography, cooking delicious food and trying to convince my backyard to grow vegetables.</p>
